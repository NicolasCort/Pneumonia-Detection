# Pneumonia Detection

A neural network (CNN) that can detect wether a patient has pneumonia or not.
For the data I used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia. 
The Chest X-ray images (anterior-posterior) were selected from retrospective cohorts of pediatric patients of one to five years old from Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center, Guangzhou. All chest X-ray imaging was performed as part of patients’ routine clinical care.

Here is an example of a patient with and without pneumonia:

For the model I used a Covolutional Neural Network (CNN), you can learn more about it here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network
