# Pneumonia Detection
I created a model that can tell you based on an x-ray chest image if the patience has pneumonia or not.
For the data I used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia. 
The Chest X-ray images (anterior-posterior) were selected from retrospective cohorts of pediatric patients of one to five years old from Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center, Guangzhou. All chest X-ray imaging was performed as part of patients’ routine clinical care.
